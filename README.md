# Why it's awesome?

Protobone is simple and lightweight. It styles raw html elements with other awesome features like Grids, Callouts. Nothing more.

* Has nearly ~900 lines of code (including comments and whitespaces)
* The minified version weighs less than 12KB and even less when gziped :sunglasses:
* It's just a starting point. Not a UI framework

---

# Browser support

Protobone supports all the browsers including the older versions of the listed browsers below. But still IE has a large degradation prior to IE9

* Chrome Latest
* Opera Latest
* IE Latest
* FireFox Latest
* Safari Latest

# Getting Started

#### HTML

You can simply add the line inside the `<head>` tag. No need of downloading, no need of compiling. Just plug and play

```html
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/normalize.css">
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/protobone.css">
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/fonts.css">
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/colors.css">
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/layout.css">
```
You can also use our protpotype index.html document which gives you a springboard to work from.
